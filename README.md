## Welcome to the course

Artificial Intelligence has made significant strides in the last couple of years especially - unexpectedly - in the creative world. OpenAI has been a major player in bringing generative artificial intelligence to the mass. For those of you who have not heard about generative AI before, it is the ability of the machine to create and produce new ideas from what it already knows. ChatGPT and DALL.E and Midjourney, to name a few, are examples of generative AI that create art (text or images) out of simple sentences provided by a user.

Caligrafy integrates seamlessly with many of the AI models provided by OpenAI to give the opportunity for developers to use them easily and to build next generation applications.

This course shows you how Caligrafy can be used to create powerful AI by interfacing seamlessly with OpenAI.
